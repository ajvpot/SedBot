SedBot
======

IRC Bot to implement sed commands on the recent buffer. Supports multiple channels.

Note: This project has some serious bugs (you can sed nicks), and should not be used. It's just a good example of how to somewhat safely execute user provided sed commands and how to use dequeues to create a buffer of IRC chat.
